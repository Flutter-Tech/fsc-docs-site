# The codebases.json File

{% include cbg/nav.html %}

`codebases.json` is the legacy definition file for [Codebase Governor](/docs/cbg/) located at the root of a capability repository (a repository with a `cap-` prefix). These docs describe the file format, but rather than updating this file you should now [migrate to v2 of Codebase Governor](/docs/cbg-v2-from-v1/).

## `version`

The version of the file format used - these docs describe the version `1.2` format.

```json
{ "version": "1.2" }
```

## `comment`

Various `comment` fields are specified throughout the format definition. This are all optional but allow free-form file commentary. They are included in the spec so they will be maintained by file auto-formatting scripts.

```json
{ "version": "1.2", "comment": ["version 1.2 codebases.json example"] }
```

## `description`

The description of the capability/product.

```json
{
  "version": "1.2",
  "comment": ["version 1.2 codebases.json example"],
  "description": "Services for pricing and transacting cashout offers"
}
```

## `capability-type`

The type of your capability/product.

| `capability-type` value | Description                                                                                                     |

## `policy`

Defines the policy for the capability/product.

```json
{
  "version": "1.2",
  "comment": ["version 1.2 codebases.json example"],
  "description": "Services for pricing and transacting cashout offers",
  "capability-type": "capability",
  "name": "Cashout",
  "owner": "robtuley",
  "maintainers": ["crisostomon", "almeidat2"],
  "contributors": [
    { "users": ["oreilco"] },
    { "teams": ["all-flutter-global"], "include": ["fcq-service"] }
  ],
  "policy": {
    "comment": "The policy is defined at the capability level and inside it you can define all the branch-protection types you need to apply at the repos level",
    "branch-protections": {
      "bp1": {
        "comment": "Capability policy - with pattern matching - it will be applied to any branches that have a name that starts with release",
        "parameters": {
          "branch-name-pattern": "release*",
          "include-administrators": true,
          "require-review-from-codeowners": true,
          "required-reviews-count": 3
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

#### **`policy.comment`**

Add information about the policy.

```json
{
  "policy": {
    "comment": "The policy is defined at the capability level and inside it you can define all the branch-protection types you need to apply at the repos level"
  }
}
```

#### **`policy.branch-protections`**

You can create several policies in **`policy.branch-protections`**, defining the branch protection settings needed for each, and reference them in **`repos.<repository>.policy.branch-protection`**. This allows you greater flexibility and reduces settings duplication.

```json
{
  "policy": {
    "comment": "The policy is defined at the capability level and inside it you can define all the branch-protection types you need to apply at the repos level",
    "branch-protections": {}
  }
}
```

#### **`policy.branch-protections.<branch_protection_id>`**

To identify a determined set of definitions for a branch-protection you have to define an ID. You can create as many IDs/sets as you need.

```json
{
  "policy": {
    "comment": "The policy is defined at the capability level and inside it you can define all the branch-protection types you need to apply at the repos level",
    "branch-protections": {
      "bp1": {},
      "bp2": {}
    }
  }
}
```

#### **`policy.branch-protections.<branch_protection_id>.comment`**

The text that adds information about the branch protection.

```json
{
  "policy": {
    "comment": "The policy is defined at the capability level and inside it you can define all the branch-protection types you need to apply at the repos level",
    "branch-protections": {
      "bp1": {
        "comment": "Branch protection comment"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

#### **`policy.branch-protections.<branch_protection_id>.parameters`**

There are several keys you can use to tailor the Codebase Governor behaviour when you create branches. You can add them here.

#### **`policy.branch-protections.<branch_protection_id>.parameters` keys**

#### Branch name pattern definition

For example, to require any branch containing the word release to have at least two pull request reviews before merging, you can create a branch rule for release.

You can also set up automatic branch protection for all branches in your repository with the wildcard syntax \*. Because GitHub uses the File::FNMPATHNAME flag for the File.fnmatch syntax, the wildcard does not match directory separators (/). For example, qa/\* will match all branches beginning with qa/ and containing a single slash. You can include multiple slashes with qa/\*\*/\_, and you can extend the qa string with qa**/**/\* to make it more inclusive. For more information about syntax options for branch rules, see the [fnmatch documentation](https://ruby-doc.org/core-2.5.1/File.html#method-c-fnmatch).

To create an exception to an existing branch rule, you can create a new branch protection rule that is higher priority, such as a branch rule for a specific branch name.

#### **Filter pattern cheat sheet**

You can use special characters in path, branch, and tag filters.

- **`*`**: Matches zero or more characters, but does not match the `/` character. For example, `dev*` matches `development`.
- **`?`**: Matches zero or one single character. For example, `produ?tion` matches `production`.
- **`+`**: Matches one or more of the preceding character.
- **`[]`** Matches one character listed in the brackets or included in ranges. Ranges can only include `a-z`, `A-Z`, and `0-9`. For example, the range`[0-9a-f]` matches any digits or lowercase letter. For example, `[CB]at` matches `Cat` or `Bat` and `[1-2]00` matches `100` and `200`.
- **`!`**: At the start of a pattern makes it negate previous positive patterns. It has no special meaning if not the first character.

#### **Patterns to match branches**

| Pattern               | Description                                                    | Example matches                              |
| :-------------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------- | :------------------------------------------- |
| `dev-*`               | The `*` wildcard matches any character.                        | -`dev-branch` -`dev-20201201`                |
| `master`              | Matches the exact name of a branch.                            | `master`                                     |
| `'*'`                 | Matches all branches name.                                     | -`main` -`releases`                          |
| `'*feature'`          | Matches branch names that end with feature.                    | -`mona-feature` -`feature` -`ver-10-feature` |
| `v2*`                 | Matches branch names that start with `v2`.                     | -`v2` -`v2.0` -`v2.9`                        |
| `v[12].[0-9]+.[0-9]+` | Matches all semantic versioning tags with major version 1 or 2 | -`v1.10.1` -`v2.0.0`                         |

**Prioritization of branch rules**

If a repository has multiple protected branch rules that affect the same branches, the rules that include a specific branch name have the highest priority. If there is more than one protected branch rule that matches the same specific branch name, then the branch rule created first will have higher priority.

Protected branch rules that mention a special character, such as `*`, `?`, or `[]`, are applied in the order they are listed, so rules that are listed first have a higher priority.

```json

  "policy": {
    "branch-protections": {
