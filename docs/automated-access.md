# Automated GitHub Access

There are many use cases where you will want to automate access or changes on GitHub, this page describes the options available to run that automation and to manage the authentication and authorisation.

The choice of automation mechanism is constrained based on how your automation is intended to be triggered and how integrated it needs to be be with divisional infrastructure

| ------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **GitHub action - hosted in GitHub** | Can be scheduled or triggered from events within any repository<br>Hosted by GitHub and easy to setup<br>Access to divisional infrastructure is limited<br> **More info:** [GitHub docs](https://docs.github.com/en/actions)                                                                                              |
| **GitHub action - self hosted**      | Can also be scheduled or triggered from events within any repository<br> Unlike GitHub hosted actions, they run within divisional infrastructure<br> **More info:** [GitHub docs](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/hosting-your-own-runnersr)                                                                           |
| **Webhook listener**                 | Repository level and organisation level activity in GitHub can trigger a call to an external webhook listener <br> These listeners need to be deployed on divisional infrastructure outside of GitHub<br> **More info:** [GitHub docs](https://docs.github.com/en/developers/webhooks-and-events/webhooks/about-webhooks) |
| **External processes**               | External processes, including webhook listeners and self hosted GitHub action runners or fully independent external processes, running on divisional infrastructure can run and be triggered by GitHub activities as well as non-GitHub activities                                                                        |

All authorisation / authentication mechanisms are available to all automation mechanisms

| **Personal access token**                 | Has the same access levels as a user or divisional 'service account', and any API calls made will appear to come from that specific user <br> It is discouraged to use this auth type <br> It is difficult to constrain the permissions to be the minimum necessary<br>It is associated strongly to a specific user, so is difficult to manage the responsibilities effectively across multiple people<br> **More info:** [GitHub docs](https://docs.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/creating-a-personal-access-token) |
| **GitHub App**                            | The **preferred way** to manage automation access across multiple repos in an organization or across multiple organizations<br> Fine grained control over what the app can do at the repository and organisation level<br> Application managers can be assigned to ensure it is managed by a team safely and effectively<br> Activities performed in GitHub will be labeled appropriately as `[bot]` activity performed by the named app<br>**More info:** [GitHub docs](https://docs.github.com/en/developers/apps/getting-started-with-apps/about-apps)                 |
| **Deploy key**                            | Deploy keys are a public/private key pair, where the public key is attached to a repository in GitHub <br> This allows automation to read/pull the repository ( by default, although write/push access can be granted ) <br> Gives git push/pull access and is **not used to make GitHub API calls**<br> Each key needs to be attached to each repository where it's required<br> **More info:** [GitHub docs](https://docs.github.com/en/developers/overview/managing-deploy-keys#deploy-keys)                                                                           |
