This branching strategy is suitable for documentation, integration test or other non-production deployed supporting repositories where changes CAN be reviewed. Audit branching ensures previous changes are visible and can be audited at any time, but does not require changes to be reviewed before they are made. It uses a simple GitHub Flow or trunk-based development branching model with more relaxed branch protection rules.
