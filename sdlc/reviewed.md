  This content is IN PROGRESS. That means it is not yet ready, and likely not yet useful.

This branching strategy is suitable for production deployed service code repositories where changes MUST be reviewed. Reviewed source is optimised for [Guest Contribution](/how/guest-contributions/) services where there is a clear owning team. It is based on a simple GitHub Flow branching model which is easy to understand and SemVer release tagging to signal production-ready builds.
