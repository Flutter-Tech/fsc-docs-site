# Community

One of the many pleasures of inner source is access to expert help, knowledge and support from the entire Flutter community. For community members this area contains links to slack channels and support teams that can help.

You are currently browsing the public inner source site so this information is not available to you. If you are already a member of this community please use the [developers.flutter.com/community/](https://developers.flutter.com/community/) internal site to access this (requires you to be a member of the `Flutter-Global` GitHub org).

## External Contact Details

For external contact on the topic of inner source at Flutter, please contact Rob Tuley (email is `rob.tuley` at `flutter.com`).
